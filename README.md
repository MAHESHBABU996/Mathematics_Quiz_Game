# Mathematics_Quiz_Game

🎯 Mathematics Quiz Game (C Language)

A console-based mathematics quiz game with random questions, scoring, and interactive menu.

📌 Project Overview

The Mathematics Quiz Game tests users on arithmetic, algebra, geometry, percentages, and basic logic.
It selects 5 random questions from a bank of 20 math questions.
Each game is unique — questions do not repeat in a single session.

This project demonstrates:

Use of structures in C

Random number generation and arrays

Menu-driven programming

Modular code with functions

Score tracking logic
